    <h2>Baroque Works</h2>
    <p>Baroque Works was a criminal syndicate created by the Warlord Crocodile to destabilize and conquer the Arabasta Kingdom (and, by extension, acquire the ancient superweapon Pluton). 
        <br>For this sole purpose, it conducted countless acts of espionage, sabotage, and murder over a span of years, ultimately manipulating Arabasta into civil war.
